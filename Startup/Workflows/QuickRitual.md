# Quick Startup Ritual

A 5-minute version for mid-day resets or when you've already done the full ritual.

## When to Use

- After a meeting, before starting next focus block
- After lunch
- When you feel scattered and need to refocus
- When full ritual isn't needed but you need direction

## Steps (5 minutes total)

### 1. Quick Dump (1 minute)

> "Anything from that meeting / break that needs capturing?"

- Capture to scratch file if yes
- Skip if nothing

### 2. Check Calendar (1 minute)

```bash
bun ~/repos/github.com/sethdf/curu-skills/_shared/api/calendar.ts next 2
```

> "You have [X] in [Y] minutes" or "Clear for the next 2 hours"

### 3. Pick ONE (2 minutes)

> "What's your ONE thing for this block?"

Options:
- Continue previous task
- Next priority from morning list
- Something urgent that came up

### 4. First Action (1 minute)

> "First action?"

Confirm it's concrete and obvious.

### 5. Go

> "Focus block: [task] until [time/meeting]. Go."

## Output Format

Next meeting: 2:00 PM Sprint Review (45 min from now)
Focus window: 45 minutes

Your ONE thing: Continue SDP-4521 investigation
