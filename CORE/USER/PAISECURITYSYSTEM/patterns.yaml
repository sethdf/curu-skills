# PATH PROTECTION
# ========================================

  # READ ONLY - Can read but cannot modify or delete
  readOnly:
    - "${PAI_DIR}/settings.json"
    - "/etc/**"

  # CONFIRM WRITE - Can read freely, writing requires confirmation
  confirmWrite:

# SPECIAL PROJECT RULES
# ========================================
# Add project-specific rules here
# Example structure:

# projects:
#   my-private-app:
#     path: "~/Projects/my-private-app"
#     rules:
#       - action: "block_git_push"
#         reason: "Deploy via CI/CD only"
#       - action: "require_confirmation"
#         pattern: "npm publish"
#         reason: "Verify version before publishing"
